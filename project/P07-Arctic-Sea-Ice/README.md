*Description*: The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project is a framework within which a number of research centres produce predictions of the future evolution of the climate. Many climate centres use an ensemble approach, in which they produce several simulations for each scenario, using the same model configuration. By comparing these multiple simulations (“the ensemble"), we can estimate the probability that the climate will evolve in a certain way.
Here, you will look at the evolution of the Arctic sea ice cover. You will try to describe the patterns of regional sea ice loss, and to identify regions that show similar patterns of variability. 
For that, we will :
 - analyse different models with the same scenario: this will allow you to see differences that are due to the way that particular models simulate the sea ice. It is a way to quantify uncertainty in the future state of the Arctic that is due to the differences between models.
 - analyse the same model in different emission scenarios: this will allow you to see how the ice loss spatial and temporal patterns might change as a function of greenhouse gas emissions.

In this folder, you will find a notebook that contains : 

 - The extraction of the data from the catalog
 - A temporal comparison of 2 ice concentration scenarios in Artic
 - A Kmeans clustering algorithm for sea ice concentration
 - A scenarios comparison (in clustering and prediction for the year 2100)
 - A model comparison (in clustering and prediction for the year 2100)
 - The evolution of the size of the differents clusters
 - A seasonal of the evolution of sea ice concentration
 - PCA to see the evolution of the arctic sea ice
